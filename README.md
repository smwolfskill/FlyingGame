# FlyingGame
Simple 3D flying game web app which showcases terrain generation, shading and fog.

The simplest way to launch the game is to create a local server using [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in a command-line interface.
Once you're in the source code directory, run the python server on port 8000:

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Or if you have python 2,

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Then open the game in your browser:

`localhost:8000/Flight.html`

To quit the server (unix) simply hit `CTRL^C` in command-line.
